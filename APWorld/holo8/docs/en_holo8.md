# holo8 (PC)

## What does Archipelago do to holo8? Isn't the game already fully random?

- Encountering and successfully determining an anomaly is a check. *You will not be given a check if you fail to detect an anomaly.*
- Certain anomalies will not be encountered until you have the respective item relating to the anomaly.
	- For instance, an anomaly containing Oozora Subaru will not be viewable until you obtain either the *Hololive Generation 2* or *Oozora Subaru* item, depending on YAML settings.
	- When playing on Generation Mode, anomalies containing members of Hololive Project HOPE and Hololive Council are consolidated into the *Hololive CouncilRyS* item.
	- This does not apply to anomalies affecting the default Ayame, Suisei and Marine characters already in the office; their anomalies are available at the start of the game.
- Various YAML settings exist to modify how anomalies generate.
	- You can choose to play with only anomalies from Normal Mode, Everyday Mode, or both at the same time.
	- There are two seperate item collection modes: *Generation Mode* and *Talent Mode*.
		- Generation Mode: Talents are grouped into their respective generations.
		- Talent Mode: Each talent is a unique item.
	- You can choose whether certain hard-to-spot anomalies, such as the blinking AZKi poster or the invisible Botan, are included as checks.
	- You can choose how often floors with no anomalies appear (though this does not affect the built-in 2 anomaly failsafe). Likewise, you can also choose the likelihood that a floor with an anomaly you have already checked can appear.
- DeathLink support: If enabled, being killed by an anomaly will kill every other player in your multiworld that has the DeathLink option enabled in their YAML. Likewise, if someone else dies in their game, you will be sent back to Floor 8.

You will need to find the *Mikodanye* and *Taranchama* items before the elevator is allowed to progress past Floor 8. Once the elevator is working again, you simply need to escape the office to goal.
